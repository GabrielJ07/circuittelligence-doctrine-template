  # Additional jobs can be added here as needed:
  # - security-scan: Run security vulnerability checks
  # - build: Build and package the application
  # - integration-tests: Run integration tests
  # - deploy: Deploy to staging/production (on specific branches)

# Notes:
# 1. This workflow provides foundation for doctrine enforcement
# 2. Both jobs use placeholder commands that always succeed (exit 0)
# 3. Replace placeholders with project-specific commands:
#    - Linting: ESLint, Prettier, stylelint, etc.
#    - Testing: Jest, Mocha, Vitest, Cypress, etc.
# 4. Required status checks should be configured in repository settings
# 5. Consider adding additional jobs for security, build, and deployment

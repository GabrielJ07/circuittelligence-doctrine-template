# Notes:
# 1. Security jobs run first and must pass before code quality jobs
# 2. All security jobs are configured to fail on detection of issues:
#    - secret-scan: Fails on detected secrets/credentials
#    - dependency-scan: Fails on vulnerable dependencies
#    - static-analysis: Fails on security code issues
# 3. TODO items indicate areas requiring project-specific configuration:
#    - Configure Gitleaks rules for specific secret patterns
#    - Set appropriate dependency vulnerability thresholds
#    - Configure CodeQL for project languages and custom queries
#    - Replace lint/test placeholders with actual commands
# 4. Consider adding additional security jobs:
#    - Container image scanning (if using Docker)
#    - Infrastructure as Code scanning (if using Terraform/CloudFormation)
#    - License compliance checking
# 5. Required status checks should be configured in repository settings

# Contributing to Circuittelligence Doctrine Projects

Welcome to the Circuittelligence ecosystem! This guide outlines our contribution process, standards, and expectations. Following these guidelines ensures code quality, team collaboration, and project sustainability.

## 🔬 Circuittelligence Contribution Philosophy

Our doctrine emphasizes **Intelligence-First** decision making, **Circuit Reliability** through robust processes, and **Collaborative Excellence** in all interactions. Every contribution should embody these principles.

## 🔄 Contribution Process Overview

The Circuittelligence contribution process follows a structured workflow: **Intake → Triage → Build → Review → Deploy**

### 1. 📥 **Intake Phase**

#### Before You Start
- [ ] **Review Documentation**: Study project README, architecture docs, and existing issues
- [ ] **Check for Duplicates**: Search existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
- [ ] **Understand Scope**: Ensure your contribution aligns with project goals and doctrine
- [ ] **Discuss Major Changes**: Open an issue for significant features or architectural changes

#### Issue Creation (Required for all contributions)
```
# Use our issue templates for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
```

### 2. 🔍 **Triage Phase**

Maintainers will triage your issue using doctrine-aligned criteria:

- **Intelligence Assessment**: Does this solve a real problem backed by data/evidence?
- **Circuit Impact**: How does this affect system reliability and maintainability?
- **Resource Allocation**: Priority based on business value and technical debt impact
- **Complexity Analysis**: Breaking down work into manageable, reviewable chunks

**Labels Applied:**
- `priority/[critical|high|medium|low]`
- `type/[bug|feature|docs|refactor]` 
- `complexity/[simple|moderate|complex]`
- `doctrine/[approved|needs-discussion|rejected]`

### 3. 🏗️ **Build Phase**

#### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Create feature branch following naming convention
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/documentation-improvement
```

#### Code Standards & Guidelines

**File Organization:**
- Follow the established directory structure
- Place files in appropriate modules/directories
- Use consistent naming conventions

**Code Quality Requirements:**
- **Lint Compliance**: All code must pass linting (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript where applicable, maintain type definitions
- **Testing**: New features require corresponding tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs, add JSDoc comments for functions
- **Security**: Follow secure coding practices, validate inputs

**Commit Message Standards:**
Use conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration
fix(api): resolve timeout issues in data fetching
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(utils): add edge case tests for validation
refactor(components): improve performance of data grid
```

**Code Review Checklist (Self-Review First):**
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] No commented-out code or TODO items
- [ ] Error handling implemented properly
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed

### 4. 👥 **Review Phase**

#### Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Title Format:** `type(scope): brief description`

**Required PR Elements:**
- [ ] **Clear Description**: What changes were made and why
- [ ] **Issue Reference**: Links to related issues (`Fixes #123`)
- [ ] **Testing Evidence**: Screenshots, test results, or deployment previews
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Document any breaking changes with migration guide
- [ ] **Checklist Completion**: All template checkboxes completed

#### Review Process & Expectations

**Automated Checks (Must Pass):**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code coverage maintains or improves existing levels
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks pass
- [ ] Security scans show no new vulnerabilities

**Human Review Requirements:**
- **Minimum Reviewers**: 1 maintainer approval required
- **Review Criteria**:
  - Code quality and maintainability
  - Adherence to doctrine principles
  - Architecture and design decisions
  - Test coverage and quality
  - Documentation completeness

**Review Response Guidelines:**
- **Be Responsive**: Address feedback within 48 hours
- **Be Collaborative**: Discuss alternative approaches openly
- **Be Professional**: Maintain respectful, constructive dialogue
- **Be Educational**: Explain your reasoning and learn from feedback

#### Mandatory Review Steps

1. **Technical Review**
   - [ ] Code architecture aligns with project patterns
   - [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable
   - [ ] Edge cases and error conditions handled

2. **Quality Review**
   - [ ] Tests provide adequate coverage and quality

   - [ ] User experience considered (for UI changes)

3. **Doctrine Compliance Review**
   - [ ] Changes embody Intelligence-First principles
   - [ ] Circuit Reliability maintained or improved
   - [ ] Collaborative Excellence demonstrated in code/docs

### 5. 🚀 **Deploy Phase**

#### Merge Requirements (All Must Be Met)
- [ ] All automated checks passing
- [ ] All review comments resolved
- [ ] At least 1 maintainer approval
- [ ] Branch up-to-date with main branch
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

#### Post-Merge Actions
- Monitor deployment and rollback if issues arise
- Update related issues and close when appropriate
- Document lessons learned for future reference

## 🎯 Quality Standards

### Code Standards
- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Write code that others can easily understand
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Modularity**: Create reusable, testable components
- **Performance**: Consider scalability and resource usage
- **Security**: Implement secure coding practices

### Documentation Standards
- **Completeness**: Document all public APIs and complex logic
- **Accuracy**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- **Accessibility**: Write for different skill levels
- **Examples**: Include practical usage examples
- **Markdown**: Follow consistent formatting standards

### Testing Standards
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- **Quality**: Write meaningful tests, not just coverage targets
- **Types**: Include unit, integration, and e2e tests as appropriate
- **Maintainability**: Keep tests simple and focused
- **Performance**: Ensure test suite remains fast and reliable

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping the Issue**: Always create/reference an issue before coding
- **Large PRs**: Keep changes focused and reviewable (< 400 lines when possible)
- **Missing Tests**: New functionality without tests will be rejected
- **Breaking Changes**: Document and discuss breaking changes in advance
- **Style Violations**: Run linters locally before pushing
- **Merge Conflicts**: Keep your branch updated with main branch

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Resources
- 📖 **[Project Documentation](docs/)** - Architecture and API docs
- 🔬 **[Circuittelligence Doctrine](docs/doctrine.md)** - Core principles and philosophy
- 💬 **GitHub Discussions** - Community questions and discussions
- 🐛 **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports and feature requests

### Support Channels
1. **Check Documentation**: Review README and docs/ directory first
2. **Search Issues**: Look through existing issues and discussions
3. **Create Issue**: Use appropriate issue template for your question
4. **Tag Maintainers**: Use `@maintainers` for urgent issues only

### Reporting Security Issues
**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:
- Email security concerns to: [security-contact-placeholder]
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Allow time for assessment and fix before disclosure

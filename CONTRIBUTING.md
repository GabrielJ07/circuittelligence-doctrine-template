# Contributing to Circuittelligence Doctrine Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to the Circuittelligence ecosystem! All contributions to this project must align with the **Circuittelligence doctrine**. This doctrine embodies our core principles of Intelligence-First decision making, Circuit Reliability through robust processes, and Collaborative Excellence in all interactions.

For complete understanding of our organizational philosophy, values, and standards, please review the [Circuittelligence Doctrine](docs/doctrine.md) before contributing.

## Contribution/Intake Process Overview

The Circuittelligence contribution process follows a structured workflow with the following required steps:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Issue Creation Required**: All contributions must start with a well-documented issue using our [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
- **Stakeholder Input**: Gather requirements from relevant stakeholders and document them clearly
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the boundaries and expected outcomes of the contribution
- **Doctrine Alignment**: Verify the contribution aligns with Intelligence-First principles

### 2. Triage
- Maintainers evaluate issues using doctrine-aligned criteria:
  - **Intelligence Assessment**: Evidence-based problem validation
  - **Circuit Impact**: Effect on system reliability and maintainability
  - **Resource Allocation**: Priority based on business value and technical debt
  - **Complexity Analysis**: Work breakdown into manageable chunks
- Labels applied: `priority/[level]`, `type/[category]`, `complexity/[level]`, `doctrine/[status]`

### 3. Assigned Lead
- Each approved issue will be assigned to a lead contributor
- Lead responsibilities include:
  - Technical implementation planning
  - Coordinating with stakeholders
  - Ensuring quality standards compliance
  - Managing the review process

### 4. Stakeholder Alignment
- Regular check-ins with stakeholders during development
- Documentation of any requirement changes
- Validation of deliverables against original requirements
- Sign-off from relevant stakeholders before merge

## Coding Standards

### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commits format following our doctrine standards:

```
type(scope): description

Optional body explaining the change in detail
Including doctrine principle alignment

Optional footer with issue references
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration with circuit reliability checks
fix(api): resolve timeout issues affecting system intelligence
docs(readme): update installation instructions per doctrine standards
test(utils): add edge case tests for validation reliability
refactor(components): improve performance following intelligence-first principles
```

**Required commit types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes  
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/modifications
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Code Style Requirements
- **Lint Compliance**: All code must pass configured linters (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript where applicable, maintain type definitions
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow established project patterns
- **File Organization**: Adhere to the enforced directory structure
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling following circuit reliability principles
- **Security**: Follow secure coding practices, validate all inputs

### Documentation Requirements
- **Code Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public functions and complex logic
- **README Updates**: Update relevant documentation for new features
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document significant design decisions in ADR format
- **API Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- **Doctrine Alignment**: Explain how changes align with doctrine principles

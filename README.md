# Circuittelligence Doctrine Template

## Project Overview

This is the official template repository for all Circuittelligence projects, serving as the foundational framework that enforces organizational structure, quality standards, and workflow automation. Every new project within the Circuittelligence ecosystem must begin with this template to ensure consistency, maintainability, and adherence to our core doctrine principles.

The template embodies the Circuittelligence doctrine - a comprehensive philosophy that bridges circuit design intelligence with software engineering excellence. It provides a structured approach to building intelligent, robust, and scalable systems through systematic processes, automated workflows, and collaborative development practices.

**Core Doctrine Principles:**
- **Intelligence-First**: Every decision backed by data and systematic analysis
- **Circuit Reliability**: Build systems that are resilient, predictable, and self-healing
- **Collaborative Excellence**: Foster team synergy through clear processes and shared standards

## Features

This template enforces the following Circuittelligence standards:

### üìÅ **Enforced Structure**
- **Standardized directory layout**: Pre-configured `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/` directories with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent file naming conventions** aligned with doctrine principles
- **Module organization** that promotes scalability and maintainability
- **Configuration templates** for common development tools

### ü§ù **Doctrine-Aligned Contributing Templates**
- **Issue templates** for bug reports, feature requests, and documentation improvements
- **Pull request templates** with comprehensive checklists and review criteria
- **Contributing guidelines** that enforce code quality and collaboration standards
- **Code of conduct** aligned with Circuittelligence values

### üîÑ **Automated Workflows**
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines** for continuous integration and deployment
- **Automated testing** with coverage reporting and quality gates
- **Code linting and formatting** with pre-commit hooks
- **Security scanning** and dependency vulnerability checks
- **Status checks** for pull request validation and approval workflows

### üìö **Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Structured README templates** with consistent formatting and required sections
- **API documentation standards** with automated generation capabilities
- **Architecture decision records (ADR)** template for design decisions
- **Detailed doctrine documentation** - see [docs/doctrine.md](docs/doctrine.md) for complete philosophy and guidelines
- **Workflow documentation** explaining development processes and standards

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to use this template for creating a new Circuittelligence project:

### Step 1: Create New Repository
```bash
# Option 1: Click "Use this template" button above
# Option 2: Use GitHub CLI
gh repo create my-new-project --template GabrielJ07/circuittelligence-doctrine-template --public
```

### Step 2: Clone and Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-new-project.git
cd my-new-project

# Verify structure
ls -la
```

### Step 3: Customize for Your Project
- **Update README.md**: Replace template content with project-specific details
- **Modify src/ structure**: Adapt directory layout for your technology stack
- **Configure workflows**: Update `.github/workflows/` files for your specific needs
- **Customize templates**: Adapt issue and PR templates in `.github/` directory
- **Review documentation**: Update `docs/` folder with project-specific documentation

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings
- **Set up branch protection**: Enable required status checks and review requirements
- **Configure team access**: Add appropriate collaborators and set permissions
- **Enable security features**: Turn on vulnerability alerts and security policies
- **Set up integrations**: Connect necessary third-party services and tools

### Step 5: Initial Commit and Validation
```bash
# Make your initial customizations
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize project from Circuittelligence doctrine template"

# Push and verify CI pipeline
git push origin main

# Verify all checks pass
gh pr checks
```

### Project Initialization Checklist
- [ ] Update project name and description in README
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules with required status checks
- [ ] Customize issue and pull request templates
- [ ] Adapt CI/CD workflows for project requirements
- [ ] Add project-specific documentation to `docs/` folder
